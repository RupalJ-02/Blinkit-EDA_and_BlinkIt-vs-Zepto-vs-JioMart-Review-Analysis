Middle Section: Product and Sales Breakdown

* FAT CONTENT (Bar Chart): Shows the total sales broken down by fat content (Low Fat and Regular). It highlights which fat content category is more popular in terms of sales.
* ITEM TYPE (Bar Chart): Displays the sales for different item types. This helps understand which product categories are driving the most revenue.
* FAT BY OUTLET (Stacked Bar Chart): Shows the sales of Low Fat and Regular items across different outlet tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3). This helps understand the relationship between fat content preference and outlet location/type.

Right Section: Outlet Analysis

* OUTLET SIZE (Donut Chart): Illustrates the distribution of outlet sizes (Medium, Small, High) and their corresponding sales contributions.
* OUTLET LOCATION (Donut Chart): Shows the percentage of outlets in different tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3) and their respective sales contributions. It also indicates the percentage of outlets located in a specific location (100% or 71.3%).
* OUTLET TYPE (Table): Provides a detailed breakdown of sales and performance metrics for different outlet types (Grocery Store, Supermarket Type 1, Supermarket Type 2, Supermarket Type 3). It includes:
* Outlet Type: The type of outlet.
* Total Sales: The total revenue generated by each outlet type.
* No. of Items: The number of items sold in each outlet type.
* Avg Sales: The average sales per transaction for each outlet type.
* Avg Rating: The average customer rating for each outlet type.
* Item Visibility: Represents the visibility or popularity of items in each outlet type.

Key Insights from the Dashboard:

* Supermarket Type 1 is the top performer in terms of total sales.
* Grocery stores have the highest average rating.
* Low Fat items contribute more to total sales than Regular items.
* Household items,Fruits and Snack Foods are among the 3 top-selling item types.
* Sales have fluctuated over the years, as shown in the Outlet Establishment chart.
* Tier 3 outlets contribute the most to sales among outlet locations.

# PART-B -LSTM Sentiment Analysis on Blinkit, Zepto, and Jiomart Reviews

This project performs sentiment analysis on e-commerce reviews using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The focus is on reviews from three specific platforms: Zepto, Jiomart, and Blinkit.

## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves determining the emotional tone of a piece of text. This project applies sentiment analysis to e-commerce reviews, aiming to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate a practical application of deep learning, specifically LSTM models, for sentiment classification in the context of e-commerce reviews. The project uses reviews from Blinkit, Zepto, and Jiomart to train and evaluate the LSTM model.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project consists of e-commerce reviews collected from publicly available sources. The reviews are labeled with their corresponding sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). The dataset is organized into separate files for Blinkit, Zepto, and Jiomart reviews.

## Methodology

The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:

### Data Loading

* The dataset is loaded into the Colab environment using the `pandas` library.
* The reviews and sentiment labels are extracted from the dataset.

### Preprocessing

* The text data is cleaned and preprocessed to remove noise, such as punctuation and special characters.
* The reviews are tokenized into individual words.
* Word embeddings are used to represent the words numerically.

### Model Building

* An LSTM model is constructed using the `keras` library.
* The model architecture includes an embedding layer, LSTM layers, and dense layers.

### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Model: A Concise Explanation
* What they are:
A special type of recurrent neural network (RNN).
Designed to learn long-term dependencies in sequences (which regular RNNs struggle with).
* Key Feature: Memory Cells
Store information over time, like a computer's memory.
Controlled by three "gates":
Forget Gate: Decides what info to remove from memory.
Input Gate: Decides what new info to store in memory.
Output Gate: Decides what info to output based on memory.
* How they Work:
Process input sequences step-by-step.
At each step:
Cell updates its memory using the gates and current input.
Continues until the whole sequence is read.
Final output used for tasks like sentiment analysis.
* Why Good for Sentiment Analysis:
Sentiment depends on relationships between words across a text.
LSTMs are good at capturing these long-range connections.
In Essence:
LSTMs have a memory that selectively keeps and discards info.
This helps them "understand" the overall sentiment of text.

### Training and Evaluation

* The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset using an appropriate optimizer and loss function.
* The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

### Prediction

* The trained model is used to predict the sentiment of new, unseen reviews.
* The predictions are presented with their corresponding confidence scores.

## Results

The project's results show the effectiveness of the LSTM model in classifying e-commerce reviews with reasonable accuracy. The specific results, including the achieved accuracy, precision, and recall, are presented in the notebook.

Accuracy: 87.6%

Precision: 0.8

Recall: 0.9

F1 Score: 0.9

Prediction test example-

example_review = "I love the fast delivery and great service!"
print(example_review)
print(f"{predict_review(example_review, model, tokenizer, label_encoder, maxlen)}\n")

output-

I love the fast delivery and great service!
1/1 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 0s 38ms/step
Sentiment: positive, Confidence: 0.97


## Power BI Dashboard

In addition to the sentiment analysis results presented in the notebook, this project also includes an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize the key findings. The dashboard provides insights into the sentiment distribution, average rating, and other metrics across the three e-commerce platforms (Blinkit, Zepto, and Jiomart).

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the viability of using deep learning techniques for sentiment analysis in the e-commerce domain. The LSTM model proves to be a valuable tool for understanding customer opinions and sentiment towards Blinkit, Zepto, and Jiomart.
